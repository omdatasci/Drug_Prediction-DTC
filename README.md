# Drug_Prediction-DTC
Predicting which drug might be appropriate for a patient with the same illness by Decision Tree Model.

Depending upon the varous factors such as age, sex, bp, cholesterol etc. the model predict accurate drug for the patient.

Project Steps-

1.Download a CSV data file of Drug samples from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets. This dataset contains the data of patients and their drug type.

2.Identified the most relevant features with different techniques(Correlation, Varience) to improve the predictive power of the model.

3.Developed and trained predictive model using Decision Tree Classification technique.

4.Built a web app of that model using flask framework and deploy the model into production environment with the help of ngrok host platform.
